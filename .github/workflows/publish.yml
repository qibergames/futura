# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# This workflow will build a package using Gradle and then publish it to GitHub packages when a release is created
# For more information see: https://github.com/actions/setup-java/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#Publishing-using-gradle

# This pipeline is triggered automatically by the `release.yml` pipeline when a new release is created.
# It will build the repository and publish the new version of the package to GitHub Packages.
